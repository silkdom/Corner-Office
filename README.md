# Corner-Office

## Motivation
The MMA program at Rotman is intensive, and thus I spend most of my day every day at uni. When thinking about what made my time at Rotman better/worse, the study room situation stood out! The rooms are often completely booked especially during peak times, which is frustrating for our perpetual groupwork assignments. 

Rooms can be booked two-days in advance, starting from 12:00AM. Many people stay up and wait for the clock to strike midnight in order to book the 'best' rooms. I created this project to alleviate my room booking issues and lay claim to the corner office!
