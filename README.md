# Corner-Office

## Motivation
The MMA program at Rotman is intensive, and thus I spend most of my day every day at uni. When thinking about what made my time at Rotman better/worse, the study room situation stood out! The rooms are often completely booked especially during peak times, which is frustrating for our perpetual groupwork assignments. 

Rooms can be booked two-days in advance, starting from 12:00AM. In order to stand a chance of booking a room, especially the 'best' rooms, you currently have to wait for the clock to strike midnight. This isn't ideal on a daily basis. What are the 'best' rooms you may say? In my opinion they are those with windows, are close to the water fountain/bathroom, and are spacious. Of all the rooms at Rotman, the corner room on the 3rd floor (3064) can be seen as the holy grail in this regard. I created this project to alleviate my room booking issues and lay claim to the corner office!

## Background

The Rotman booking system is fairly simple but heavily constrained.
